# Front-end-challenge

# Information
The challenge is developed in Angular, all the HTML code is in **app.component.html** and the CSS in **app.component.css**

# How run the program
- Clone the repository
- Navigate to project root
- Run _npx ng serve_

# Additional information
The buttons and other components do not have functionality developed with JS.

Do not use a large repertoire of images but work with only four.

I couldn't finish the challenge completely due to lack of time but I hope you can see a good command of CSS and HTML.

_Thank you for reading the entire README.MD I hope you like the application_
